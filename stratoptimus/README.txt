### Actions

Actions are the fundamental building blocks of the project's workflow automation, encapsulating specific tasks and operations. Each action is defined as a Python class inheriting from `metagpt.actions.Action` and utilizes `ActionNode` instances to specify expected inputs and instructions.

#### Examples of Actions:

- **WritePRD:** Manages the creation and updating of Product Requirement Documents.
- **WriteDesign:** Handles the generation and refinement of system design documentation.
- **WriteCode:** Implements code based on predefined specifications and designs.
- **WriteCodeReview:** Conducts code reviews, providing constructive feedback and improvement suggestions.
- **WriteTest:** Develops and maintains automated test suites to ensure code reliability.
- **Research:** Performs in-depth research on trading strategies and market dynamics to inform strategy development.

#### File: `actions/project_management_an.py`

```python:actions/project_management_an.py
from typing import List, Optional
from metagpt.actions.action_node import ActionNode

REQUIRED_PACKAGES = ActionNode(
    key="Required packages",
    expected_type=Optional[List[str]],
    instruction="Provide required third-party packages in requirements.txt format.",
    example=["flask==1.1.2", "bcrypt==3.2.0"],
)

# Additional ActionNodes defined similarly...

NODES = [
    REQUIRED_PACKAGES,
    REQUIRED_OTHER_LANGUAGE_PACKAGES,
    LOGIC_ANALYSIS,
    TASK_LIST,
    FULL_API_SPEC,
    SHARED_KNOWLEDGE,
    ANYTHING_UNCLEAR_PM,
]

REFINED_NODES = [
    REQUIRED_PACKAGES,
    REQUIRED_OTHER_LANGUAGE_PACKAGES,
    REFINED_LOGIC_ANALYSIS,
    REFINED_TASK_LIST,
    FULL_API_SPEC,
    REFINED_SHARED_KNOWLEDGE,
    ANYTHING_UNCLEAR_PM,
]

PM_NODE = ActionNode.from_children("PM_NODE", NODES)
REFINED_PM_NODE = ActionNode.from_children("RefinedPM_NODE", REFINED_NODES)
```

### Workflows

Workflows define the sequence of actions and their interactions, orchestrating the project's development lifecycle from requirement gathering to strategy optimization.

#### Examples of Workflows:

- **Initial Strategy Development:** Establishes the foundational trading strategy based on initial requirements and designs.
- **Incremental Improvements:** Continuously refines and optimizes the strategy through iterative feedback and testing.
- **Performance Testing and Optimization:** Evaluates strategy performance using historical data and adjusts parameters to enhance effectiveness.

#### File: `Trading/workflows/template/op_prompt.py`

```python:Trading/workflows/template/op_prompt.py
# Prompts for various operations including trading strategy optimization

PARAMETER_OPTIMIZATION_PROMPT = """
Optimize the following trading strategy parameters based on historical performance data. Provide the optimized values for each parameter to maximize the strategy's effectiveness.

Current Parameters:
{current_parameters}

In your response:
1. Suggest optimized values for each parameter.
2. Explain the rationale behind each suggested optimization.
3. Ensure that the proposed changes aim to improve key performance metrics such as total return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown.

Provide your response in a structured format with each parameter and its suggested optimized value.
"""

# Additional prompts defined similarly...
```

### Prompts

Prompts are meticulously crafted templates that guide the AI in executing specific tasks, ensuring consistency and accuracy in responses. They are stored in dedicated Python modules and used by corresponding actions during the workflow.

#### File: `prompts/optimize_prompt.py`

```python:prompts/optimize_prompt.py
WORKFLOW_OPTIMIZE_PROMPT = """You are building a Graph and corresponding Prompt to jointly solve {type} problems. 
Referring to the given graph and prompt, which forms a basic example of a {type} solution approach, 
please reconstruct and optimize them. You can add, modify, or delete nodes, parameters, or prompts. Include your 
single modification in XML tags in your reply. Ensure they are complete and correct to avoid runtime failures. When 
optimizing, you can incorporate critical thinking methods like review, revise, ensemble (generating multiple answers through different/similar prompts, then voting/integrating/checking the majority to obtain a final answer), selfAsk, etc. Consider 
Python's loops (for, while, list comprehensions), conditional statements (if-elif-else, ternary operators), 
or machine learning techniques (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, neural networks, clustering). The graph 
complexity should not exceed 10. Use logical and control flow (IF-ELSE, loops) for a more enhanced graphical 
representation. Ensure that all the prompts required by the current graph from prompt_custom are included. Exclude any other prompts.
Output the modified graph and all the necessary Prompts in prompt_custom (if needed).
The prompt you need to generate is only the one used in `prompt_custom.XXX` within Custom. Other methods already have built-in prompts and are prohibited from being generated. Only generate those needed for use in `prompt_custom`; please remove any unused prompts in prompt_custom.
the generated prompt must not contain any placeholders.
Considering information loss, complex graphs may yield better results, but insufficient information transmission can omit the solution. It's crucial to include necessary context during the process."""
