WORKFLOW_OPTIMIZE_PROMPT = """You are building a Graph and corresponding Prompt to jointly solve trading strategy optimization problems. 
Referring to the given graph and prompt, which forms a basic example of a trading strategy optimization approach, 
please reconstruct and optimize them. You can add, modify, or delete nodes, parameters, or prompts. Include your 
single modification in XML tags in your reply. Ensure they are complete and correct to avoid runtime failures. When 
optimizing, you can incorporate critical thinking methods like review, revise, ensemble (generating multiple answers through different/similar prompts, then voting/integrating/checking the majority to obtain a final answer), selfAsk, etc. Consider 
Python's loops (for, while, list comprehensions), conditional statements (if-elif-else, ternary operators), 
or machine learning techniques (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, neural networks, clustering). The graph 
complexity should not exceed 10. Use logical and control flow (IF-ELSE, loops) for a more enhanced graphical 
representation. Ensure that all the prompts required by the current graph from prompt_custom are included. Exclude any other prompts.
Output the modified graph and all the necessary Prompts in prompt_custom (if needed).
The prompt you need to generate is only the one used in `prompt_custom.XXX` within Custom. Other methods already have built-in prompts and are prohibited from being generated. Only generate those needed for use in `prompt_custom`; please remove any unused prompts in prompt_custom.
The generated prompt must not contain any placeholders.
Considering information loss, complex graphs may yield better results, but insufficient information transmission can omit the solution. It's crucial to include necessary context during the process."""

Here is a graph and the corresponding prompt (prompt only related to the custom method) that performed excellently in a previous iteration (maximum score is 1). You must make further optimizations and improvements based on this graph. The modified graph must differ from the provided example, and the specific differences should be noted within the <modification>xxx</modification> section.

<sample>
    <experience>{experience}</experience>
    <modification>(such as: add a review step/delete a operator/modify a prompt)</modification>

{log}

First, provide optimization ideas. **Only one detail point can be modified at a time**, and no more than 5 lines of code may be changed per modificationâ€”extensive modifications are strictly prohibited to maintain project focus!
When introducing new functionalities in the graph, please make sure to import the necessary libraries or modules yourself, except for operator, prompt_custom, create_llm_instance, and CostManager, which have already been automatically imported.
**Under no circumstances should Graph output None for any field.**
Use custom methods to restrict your output format, rather than using code (outside of the code, the system will extract answers based on certain rules and score them).
It is very important to format the Graph output answers, you can refer to the standard answer format in the log.

```
# You can write your own prompt in <prompt>prompt_custom</prompt> and then use it in the Custom method in the graph

# You can also concatenate previously generated string results in the input to provide more comprehensive contextual information.

Note: In custom, the input and instruction are directly concatenated (instruction + input), and placeholders are not supported. Please ensure to add comments and handle the concatenation externally.

**Introducing multiple operators at appropriate points can enhance performance. If you find that some provided operators are not yet used in the graph, try incorporating them.**
